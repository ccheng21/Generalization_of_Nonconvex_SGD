# Generalization of Nonconvex SGD
The python files of "cifar10_randomlabel.py" and "neural_network_v5.py" create and store the required results for CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets respectively, such as "gradient variance" and "generalization error (GE)". The MatLab file "plot_gradvar_ge.m" is used to generate the required figures using those results. Besides, one can search all the hyper-parameters inside the python files and then adjust them. An example result is shown in the folder "BEST_20200802_epoch_cifar10_2000_mnist_1000_bs192".
